title:  "Enforcing Simplicity"
date: 2024-04-14

Simplicity is often repeated as a mantra for living a better life. 
Minimalism has become a household name, and stories of people giving at all up to live a simple life in the country are prevalent online and complexity, simplicity's antonym has become vilified.
However "simplicity" in its simplicity can be ambiguous.  
I think there are at least two different concepts people refer to: [^1]
> *Simplicity of obligation*:  
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The "what", needing to do fewer things and having less obligations.  
> *Simplicity of process*:  
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The "how", having less complex ways of doing the things you want to/ must do.  

For the purpose of this post I will be focusing on the second type, *simplicity of process*.
I hope that, in the era of self-help books and productivity gurus, *"how" simplicity* might show a simpler approach.

### Complexity Casestudy
Complexity is not only confined to personal scales, it also prevalent and oft critiqued in large organisations.
These large organisations are more likely to be studied, and as such are easier to get information on, for example the tax code, which is often criticised for its complexity.
Despite the frequent criticism, tax codes tend not to get simplified, rather getting more complex with time.
This happens because there are pressures that keep the current system in place.
In the case of the US tax code, the complexity causing "loopholes" primarily serve private citizens and as such most people want them to remain[^2][^3].
If we generalise from this meagre evidence, the problem is less akin to tidying a messy room, but more about identifying the reasons & pressures that keep it messy.  
The two main forces at play are inertia, and additive bias.  
&nbsp; Inertia makes it difficult for large and complex bodies to change the way they operate.  
&nbsp; Additive bias is a preference for adding new rules and systems, rather than removing old ones.  
Together these pressures ensure that messy and complex systems stay complex and that encountering novel problems is more likely to increase complexity rather than decrease it.

### Simple Simplification
If you want to simplify, the desire is not enough, you need to have a direction in which to take it [^4].
Once the dimension and direction in which you want to simplify its clear, you are ready to start simplifying.
A way to target your efforts is by focusing on "systems", which can encompass anything from routines and habits, to general interaction philosophies.
Systems should have a specific goal they want to achieve, eg. managing your to-do list, and a way to achieve them, eg. keeping a journal.
Conceiving of things as "systems" lets you focus on one thing at a time, with clear processes and goals.

Fortunately most systems are subject to the simplifying presence of laziness.
We have naturally evolved to avoid spending energy unless the reward is high enough, which works in our favour when we try to complicate what need not be.
Whilst you might feel bad about this, this is a natural process and is helpful in our current context.
If however, relying on natural laziness was enough I would not be writing this post, more simplifying pressure is required.
The key difficulty with adding simplifying pressure is not adding more complexity.
A common approach is performing daily/weekly/monthly "reviews" where you can review your systems simplifying as you go.
Whilst they are helpful, they often add more complexity than they save.
Therefore I propose the following two step process:  

1. **Look out for triggers.**  
Triggers are anything that prompt you to remember to simplify.
Some examples can be: a problem you run into that requires a new solution/ system, seeing someone perform a task more efficiently than you,
artificial or natural randomness shaking up your routine and showing you a new perspective, or a system you want to abandon due to laziness.
All of these can point your attention to systems that might need to change. 

2. **Simplify**  
Rather than coming up with a simple tweak to the system that solves the triggering problem, consider simplifying the system as a whole.
Key to this is finding new approaches to achieve the goal the system is meant to achieve.  
One option is to ask people about their ideas, or even better about what they do.
If you do, be careful not to pigeon-hole yourself into a specific approach.  
Another is to look for older approaches from "back in the day" that are generally considered more "primitive".
This final solution has two advantages.
Firstly they would be less reliant on tech, and thus are more accessible and easier to "hack" into a version that suits your personal circumstances.
Secondly older solutions would have had time to evolve, with all the associated benefits.


The previous approach helps gradually simplify existing systems, but you must also be weary of adding new systems.
It can be easy to think that some new system/idea will help you and fix your life.
You are most likely to be exposed to ideas that click/ spread well/ are marketed well, as such most of what you are exposed to will sound incredibly useful.
But if they do not solve a problem you already had, they might not help you at all.
        
### Terminal Thoughts
I hope this post at the very least made you think, and in the best case helps you live a better life.
Simplicity need not be the end all goal of all things, and sometimes complexity can add a ritualistic beauty to otherwise mundane events.
But for those events that needn't be beautiful and need to be over, simplicity might be the way to go.

They seem meaningfully different and unifying them proved difficult, but that does not mean they are in fact different.
