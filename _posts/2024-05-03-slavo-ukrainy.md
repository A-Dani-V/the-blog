### Slava Ukrayini
Staying up till 3am studying in vain  
Waking up shocked by a look of pain.  
You forget your examination.  
Hear that you're going on a vacation.  
You know your parents just told a lie.  
Cause a missile flew on by.  

You left your favourite jeans behind.  
Instead taking the black, stealthier kind.  
Ready to offer the troops your aid.  
Packing nought but cucumber band aids.  

Worst traffic you've ever seen.  
But you still wait for the lights.  
Explosions replacing birdsong.  
And the radio tells broken lies:  
"Ukraine doing bad wrong"  
But it'll be alright.  

Calmly settle into a new routine.  
Strolling to basements as sirens keen.  
Correcting room-mates in Italy.  
Teaching Molotov mixology.  
A new apocalypse every three months.  
Yet you're still going strong.  

Wearing blue and yellow every day.  
Teaching the curious how to say:  
Glory to Ukraine  
Slava Ukrayini
